## 1. Project Overview  

### Project Name  
**Women Safety Application**

### Purpose of the Application  

The Women Safety Application is designed to provide quick and reliable assistance to women during emergency situations. The application helps users alert trusted contacts and share their live location when they feel unsafe. The primary purpose of the system is to reduce response time during critical situations and ensure that help can be reached as early as possible.

### Problem It Solves  

Women often face situations where they feel unsafe but are unable to seek help immediately due to fear, panic, or limited access to support. In many cases, help is delayed because there is no fast and simple way to inform others about the situation. Existing solutions depend mostly on manual actions, which may not always be possible during emergencies. This application addresses these issues by enabling instant alerts, automatic detection of danger, and continuous location sharing to ensure timely assistance.

## 2. Problem Statement – Description  

Personal safety remains a major concern, especially during travel, late hours, or unfamiliar environments. In emergency situations, individuals may not have enough time or ability to make calls or explain their situation clearly. Panic and stress further reduce the chances of seeking help effectively.

Many safety systems lack real-time monitoring and do not provide continuous support once an alert is raised. After an emergency message is sent, there is often no follow-up or tracking, which limits the effectiveness of the response. Additionally, delays in communication can result in serious consequences.

There is a need for a reliable safety solution that can detect danger situations quickly, notify trusted contacts immediately, and continue monitoring until the user is confirmed safe. The Women Safety Application is proposed to fulfill this need by providing proactive and continuous safety support.
